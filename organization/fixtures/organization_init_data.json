The 2015 Summer Intensive will consist of 2 cohorts of 40 students total. The curriculum includes a rigorous computer science course, but also a soft-skills curriculum (leadership, innovation, team-work, etc.) that would help our students stand out years later when they enter the talent pipeline of top companies. ASC’s purpose is to give young African-American men an early introduction to the world of technology, providing a mode of entry to an industry that has been closed to them. (To twist the old Walt Disney line: “If you can’t see it, you can’t dream it.”)",
